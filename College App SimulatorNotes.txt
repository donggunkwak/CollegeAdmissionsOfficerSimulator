General Overview:
Simulate the college admissions process from the perspective of an admissions officer by rejecting, deferring, and maybe accepting a host of wacky applications!


1. Setup


1.1 What comprises an application?
	* An application will include a photo of the student, name, easy info (this includes gpa, gender, race, extracurriculars, any possible legacies), a short essay, a list of applications, and a preferred major
	1.2 How are the applications made?
	* The name and photo will be randomly generated via thispersondoesnotexist.com and https://www.behindthename.com/random/. 
* All other application elements will be taken from pregenerated databases with examples of each. Some examples are in the ‘Activities/Extracurriculars’ document.
	1.3 How are the quota stats generated?
	* Each school will have set target quotas based on either a pregenerated database or actual admissions/enrollment data.
	1.4 How are rounds set up?
	* There are two rounds per game, ‘Early Decision’, which has deferral as an option for students, and ‘Regular Decision’, which has a ‘waitlist’ option in place of ‘deferral’.
* The player will be shown a more comprehensive stats screen at the end of the regular decision round.
	

2. Gameplay
   1. User Interatcion
      1. Click one of three buttons
         1. Accept
         2. Reject
         3. Defer


2.1How do you play?
	* Players will overlook the application then click the button representing their decision(accept, deny, defer, waitlist)
	2.2When does the game end?
	* Every time you make a decision, you affect stats for your school. If these stats get too low (or fairly high), you might trigger a special event. If you fail the special event or continue to fail your stats, your game will end prematurely (the college closes), otherwise
	2.3 What are the special events?
	* Special events are events that either give the player a chance to raise a meter by a lot or penalize the player by having a meter decrease a lot. These events will occur more often if a meter gets on the lower or higher end of the spectrum. 
   * An example of one of these would be a discrimination lawsuit or a student with billionaire parents applying.

	How do the stats change?
	* Each student will have values for each quality based upon their gpa, race, activities, etc. as well as some randomized variance.
   * If you accept too many students or accept students with lower GPAs/ACTs, the Prestige decreases.
   * If you don’t accept enough legacy students, the Legacy decreases.
   * If you accept too many financial aid students, the Wealth decreases.
   * Diversity is affected by the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity of students accepted.
   * If you accept too few athletes, the Sports will suffer.
	What are the special events?
	* Special events are events that either give the player a chance to raise a meter by a lot or penalize the player by having a meter decrease a lot. These events will occur more often if a meter gets on the lower or higher end of the spectrum.

	Walkthrough Gameplay
	* Select a school to be an admissions counselor for
* You will see a screen like the illustration below
* A list of students will be in queue
* Upon reading the student’s profile, determine whether or not they would advance the school’s goals → make a decision for the student (accept, waitlist, reject)
* An appropriate page (describing the decision) will show for approximately 10 seconds
* The screen will then return to the normal student queue page
* No more students to examine → a page will pop up that illustrates your winning status
   * If your decisions allow for the school’s quotas to be met, you win; if not, you lose
